It eventually became the fastest-growing pizza chain in the country.

Little Kato's Pizzeria uses quality ingredients, including a blend of fresh mozzarella and cheddar cheese. They also use vine-ripened, fresh-packed Mississippi crushed tomatoes to make their sauce. At Kato's Pizzeria, one large topping tasty pizza goes for as low as $6
